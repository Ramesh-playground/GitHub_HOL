## Objective
Learn how to configure branch protection policies for the default branch of a GitHub repository. This exercise ensures that changes to critical branches, such as `main`, meet certain requirements before being merged, enhancing code quality and repository integrity. Learn and practice the **GitHub Flow** by collaboratively working on a Java web application. This exercise focuses on creating issues for traceability, working with feature branches, modifying code, creating pull requests, and merging changes into the main branch.

## Prerequisites
1. **Git installed** on your local machine for managing the repository.
