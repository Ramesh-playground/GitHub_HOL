# Developer_workflow GitHub Flow

## Objective
Learn how to configure branch protection policies for the default branch of a GitHub repository. This exercise ensures that changes to critical branches, such as main, meet certain requirements before being merged, enhancing code quality and repository integrity. Additionally, practice the **GitHub Flow** by collaboratively working on a application. This exercise focuses on creating issues for traceability, working with feature branches, modifying code, creating pull requests, and merging changes into the main branch.

## Prerequisites
1. **Git installed** on your local machine for managing the repository.

## Task-1: Enable Branch Protection Policy for the Default Branch

## Steps to Follow
1. Create a repository
2. Navigate to the created repository.
3. Go to the **Settings** tab of the repository on GitHub.
