# Exercise 2: Enable Branch Protection Policy for the Default Branch

## Objective
Learn how to configure branch protection policies for the default branch of a GitHub repository. This exercise ensures that changes to critical branches, such as `main`, meet certain requirements before being merged, enhancing code quality and repository integrity.

## Prerequisites

- A repository with a default branch (e.g., `main`) already set up.
- Understanding of pull requests and status checks in GitHub.

## Steps to Follow
1. Go to the **Settings** tab of the repository on GitHub.
