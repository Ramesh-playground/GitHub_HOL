3. Verify the Changes in the Main Branch
  - Navigate to the **main** branch in your repository.
  - Review the updated files and confirm that the changes have been successfully merged.

### Advanced Best Practices
- **Use Branch Naming Conventions:** Use consistent naming patterns, e.g., `feature` or `bugfix/fix-login-issue`.
- **Squash Commits:** Before merging, consider squashing commits to keep the main branch history clean and concise.
- **Enable Branch Protection Rules:** Set up branch protection rules to enforce approvals, passing checks, and linear history.
- **Review Automation:** Use GitHub Actions or bots to enforce code quality checks, run tests, or tag reviewers automatically.
- **Post-Merge Actions:** After merging:
  - Delete the feature branch to keep the repository tidy.
  - Inform stakeholders of the merge if needed.

> Following these advanced practices ensures a smooth collaboration process, minimizes conflicts, and maintains high code quality in your projects.
